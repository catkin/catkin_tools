                    [PKGNAME [PKGNAME ...]]

Build one or more packages in a catkin workspace. This invokes `CMake`,
`make`, and optionally `make install` for either all or the specified packages
in a catkin workspace. Arguments passed to this verb can temporarily override
persistent options stored in the catkin profile config. If you want to save
these options, use the --save-config argument. To see the current config, use
the `catkin config` command.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --workspace WORKSPACE, -w WORKSPACE
                        The path to the catkin_tools workspace or a directory
                        contained within it (default: ".")
  --profile PROFILE     The name of a config profile to use (default: active
                        profile)
  --dry-run, -n         List the packages which will be built with the given
                        arguments without building them.
  --get-env PKGNAME     Print the environment in which PKGNAME is built to
                        stdout.

Packages:
  Control which packages get built.

  PKGNAME               Workspace packages to build, package dependencies are
                        built as well unless --no-deps is used. If no packages
                        are given, then all the packages are built.
  --this                Build the package containing the current working
                        directory.
  --no-deps             Only build specified packages, not their dependencies.
  --unbuilt             Build packages which have yet to be built.
  --start-with PKGNAME  Build a given package and those which depend on it,
                        skipping any before it.
  --start-with-this     Similar to --start-with, starting with the package
                        containing the current directory.
  --continue-on-failure, -c
                        Try to continue building packages whose dependencies
                        built successfully even if some other requested
                        packages fail to build.

Build:
  Control the build behavior.

  --force-cmake         Runs cmake explicitly for each catkin package.
  --pre-clean           Runs `make clean` before building each package.
  --no-install-lock     Prevents serialization of the install steps, which is
                        on by default to prevent file install collisions

Config:
  Parameters for the underlying build system.

  --save-config         Save any configuration options in this section for the
                        next build invocation.
  -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS  Maximum number of build jobs to be distributed across
                        active packages. (default is cpu count)
  -p PACKAGE_JOBS, --parallel-packages PACKAGE_JOBS
                        Maximum number of packages allowed to be built in
                        parallel (default is cpu count)
  --jobserver           Use the internal GNU Make job server which will limit
                        the number of Make jobs across all active packages.
  --no-jobserver        Disable the internal GNU Make job server, and use an
                        external one (like distcc, for example).
  --env-cache           Re-use cached environment variables when re-sourcing a
                        resultspace that has been loaded at a different stage
                        in the task.
  --no-env-cache        Don't cache environment variables when re-sourcing the
                        same resultspace.
  --cmake-args ARG [ARG ...]
                        Arbitrary arguments which are passed to CMake. It
                        collects all of following arguments until a "--" is
                        read.
  --no-cmake-args       Pass no additional arguments to CMake.
  --make-args ARG [ARG ...]
                        Arbitrary arguments which are passed to make. It
                        collects all of following arguments until a "--" is
                        read.
  --no-make-args        Pass no additional arguments to make (does not affect
                        --catkin-make-args).
  --catkin-make-args ARG [ARG ...]
                        Arbitrary arguments which are passed to make but only
                        for catkin packages. It collects all of following
                        arguments until a "--" is read.
  --no-catkin-make-args
                        Pass no additional arguments to make for catkin
                        packages (does not affect --make-args).

Interface:
  The behavior of the command-line interface.

  --verbose, -v         Print output from commands in ordered blocks once the
                        command finishes.
  --interleave-output, -i
                        Prevents ordering of command output when multiple
                        commands are running at the same time.
  --no-status           Suppresses status line, useful in situations where
                        carriage return is not properly supported.
  --summarize, --summary, -s
                        Adds a build summary to the end of a build; defaults
                        to on with --continue-on-failure, off otherwise
  --no-summarize, --no-summary
                        Explicitly disable the end of build summary
  --override-build-tool-check
                        use to override failure due to using differnt build
                        tools on the same workspace.
  --limit-status-rate LIMIT_STATUS_RATE, --status-rate LIMIT_STATUS_RATE
                        Limit the update rate of the status bar to this
                        frequency. Zero means unlimited. Must be positive,
                        default is 10 Hz.
  --no-notify           Suppresses system pop-up notification.
