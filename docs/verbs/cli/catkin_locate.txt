usage: catkin locate [-h] [--workspace WORKSPACE] [--profile PROFILE] [-e]
                     [-r] [-q] [-s | -b | -d | -i] [--shell-verbs]

                     [PACKAGE]

Get the paths to various locations in a workspace.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --workspace WORKSPACE, -w WORKSPACE
                        The path to the catkin_tools workspace or a directory
                        contained within it (default: ".")
  --profile PROFILE     The name of a config profile to use (default: active
                        profile)

Behavior:
  -e, --existing-only   Only print paths to existing directories.
  -r, --relative        Print relative paths instead of the absolute paths.
  -q, --quiet           Suppress warning output.

Sub-Space Options:
  Get the absolute path to one of the following locations in the given
  workspace with the given profile.

  -s, --src             Get the path to the source space.
  -b, --build           Get the path to the build space.
  -d, --devel           Get the path to the devel space.
  -i, --install         Get the path to the install space.

Package Directories:
  Get the absolute path to package directories in the given workspace and
  sub-space. By default this will output paths in the workspace's source
  space. If the -b (--build) flag is given, it will output the path to the
  package's build directory. If the -d or -i (--devel or --install) flags
  are given, it will output the path to the package's share directory in
  that space. If no package is provided, the base space paths are printed,
  e.g. `catkin locate -s` might return `/path/to/ws/src` and `catkin locate
  -s foo` might return `/path/to/ws/src/foo`.

  PACKAGE               The name of a package to locate.

Special Directories:
  Get the absolute path to a special catkin location

  --shell-verbs         Get the path to the shell verbs script.
  --examples            Get the path to the examples directory.
