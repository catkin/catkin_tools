``catkin env`` -- Environment Utility
=====================================

The ``env`` verb can be used to both print the current environment variables and run a command in a modified environment.
This verb is supplied as a cross-platform alternative to the UNIX ``env`` command or the ``cmake -E environment`` command.
It is primarily used in the build stage command reproduction.
