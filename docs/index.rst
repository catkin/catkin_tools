This Python package provides command line tools for working with catkin and catkin workspaces.

The ``catkin`` command
----------------------

The ``catkin`` Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool is the single point of entry for most of the functionality provided by this package.
All invocations of the ``catkin`` CLI tool take this form:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ catkin [global options] <verb> [verb arguments and options]

The ``catkin`` CLI tool requires that you provide a verb.
The verbs could be many things, like ``build`` which builds a catkin workspace or ``list`` which simply lists the catkin packages found in one or more folders.
Optionally, global options can be provided before the verb, things like ``-d`` for debug level verbosity or ``-h`` for help on the ``catkin`` CLI tool itself.
Verbs can take arbitrary arguments and options, but they must all come after the verb.
For more help on a particular verb, simply pass ``-h`` or ``--help`` after the verb.

Verb aliasing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``catkin`` command allows you to create verb "aliases" and it also comes with some defaults.
Verb aliases are defined in YAML files in the ``verb_aliases`` folder in the catkin config folder.
The catkin config folder is located at ``~/.config/catkin``, therefore the alias files are located in ``~/.config/catkin/verb_aliases``.
By default there is one file in that directory called ``00-default-aliases.yaml``, but any files in that folder which end with either ``.yaml`` or ``.yml`` will be processed.
The built-in file should not be edited, because it is kept up-to-date by the ``catkin`` command.

Verb alias files are processed in sorted order, so making files which start with larger numbers will override files with smaller numbers.
In this way you can override the built-in aliases using a file which starts with a higher number.
For example, the ``install: build --install`` alias exists in the default file, but you can create this file to override it (``~/.config/catkin/verb_aliases/01-my-aliases.yml``):

.. code-block:: yaml

    install: build --install 

You can also nullify or unset aliases by setting their values to ``null``.
So, for example, the ``ls: list`` alias is defined in the default aliases, you can override it with this entry in a custom file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ls: null

You can list the available aliases using the ``--list-aliases`` option to the ``catkin`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ catkin --list-aliases
    i: install
    b: build
    ls: list
    install: build --install

Additionally, verb aliases can be recursive, for instance the ``i`` alias expands to ``install`` and that alias in turn expands to ``build --install``.
The ``catkin`` command shows the expansion of aliases so that the behavior is more transparent:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ catkin i
    ==> Expanding alias 'i' from 'catkin i' to 'catkin install'
    ==> Expanding alias 'install' from 'catkin install' to 'catkin build --install'
    ...

Built-in ``catkin`` command verbs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :doc:`build: Verb for building a catkin workspace <commands/catkin_build>`
- :doc:`list: Verb for finding and listing information about catkin packages <commands/catkin_list>`

Extending the ``catkin`` command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to add a verb to the ``catkin`` command, please read this document: :doc:`development/extending_the_catkin_command`

Installing
----------

You can install the ``catkin_tools`` package as a binary through a package manager like ``pip`` or ``apt-get``, or from source.

Installing on Ubuntu with apt-get
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First you must have the ROS repositories which contain the ``.deb`` for ``catkin_tools``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
    $ wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

Once you have added that repository, run these commands to install ``catkin_tools``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools

Installing on other platforms with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simply install it with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install -U catkin_tools

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First clone the source for ``catkin_tools``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools.git
    $ cd catkin_tools

Then install with the ``setup.py`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install

Developing
----------

Listed here are some useful tips for developing against ``catkin_tools``.

Install ``catkin_tools`` for developing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To setup ``catkin_tools`` for fast iteration during development, use the ``develop`` verb to ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py develop

Now the commands, like ``catkin``, will be in the system path and the local source files located in the ``catkin_tools`` folder will be on the ``PYTHONPATH``. When you are done with your development, undo this by running this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py develop -u
