Shell support in ``catkin`` command
===================================

You can use the command ``catkin --locate-extra-shell-verbs`` to locate the shell file for your installation.
When you source the resulting file, you can use ``bash``/``zsh`` shell functions which provide added utility.

.. code-block:: shell

    . `catkin --locate-extra-shell-verbs`

Provided verbs are:

- ``catkin cd`` -- Change to package directory in source space.
- ``catkin source`` -- Source the devel space or install space of the containing workspace.
