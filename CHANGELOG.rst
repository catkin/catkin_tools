^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.6.0 (2020-06-03)
------------------
* This release restores the 0.4.5 state due to an accident with the 0.5.0 release where we pushed it to Python2 users which it doesn't support.

0.5.0 (2020-06-02)
------------------
* Revert "jobs: Fixing environment required to run catkin test targets on pre-indigo catkin" (`#600 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/600>`_)
  This reverts commit 050de443da4a65be23b6f62a954efea60db53d09 and partially c5daf4a6d4cb02ab7c22a553a565bddadbaa2a45.
* Doc updates: usage of ``-d`` on cheat sheet, updated verb .txt files (`#604 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/604>`_)
  - The ``-d|--directory`` feature was introduced in `#572 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/572>`_
  - Also ran ``dump_cli`` to update help literally included on verb documentation
  pages. This updated more than just ``docs/verbs/cli/catkin_list.txt``, but they
  were in need of an update
* Add ``--this`` option to ``locate`` verb (addresses `#552 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/552>`_) (`#605 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/605>`_)
* Merge pull request `#608 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/608>`_ from mikepurvis/fix-build-type
  Check build_type with function from catkin_pkg.
* Flake8 fixes for new warnings.
* Switch to get_build_type from catkin_pkg.
* Add failing test for an ament/catkin package.
* Allow extending profiles and merging their contents. (`#592 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/592>`_)
* Updated regex for extracting '-l' and '-j' args for make (`#573 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/573>`_)
  * Updated regex for extracting '-l' and '-j' args for make
  Summary of improvements:
  - No longer consuming args that happen to begin ``jX`` or ``lX`` (where ``X`` is a
  sequence if integers.
  - Fixed bug where an empty 'j' arg would throw a ``ValueError`` when trying to
  convert an empty string (``''``) to an int
  - Both ``-l/--load-average`` and ``-j/--jobs`` can now be empty (which is
  supported by GNU Make
  - The ``-l/--load-average`` arg will now accept a float value (e.g. ``catkin build -l4.0``) which is supported by GNU Make
  * Added test cases for make args regular expressions
  Test cases also helped to make regexes slightly more robust.
* Do not ignore metapackages (fix `#418 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/418>`_) (`#596 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/596>`_)
  Metapackages must not be ignored by catkin_tools. The fact that other non-metapackages
  cannot depend on them according to REP-140 does not imply that they do not need to be
  built and installed at all.
* Catch BlockingIOError in job_server. (`#599 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/599>`_)
* Drop parentheses from yields and returns (`#595 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/595>`_)
* Use distutils to handle install path (`#569 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/569>`_)
* Update release suites. (`#564 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/564>`_)
  * Add cosmic, disco, and eoan suites.
  * Remove old suites.
  * Bump Python3 version to 3.5 in stdeb.
  * Drop jessie as a supported target.
  * Add focal.
  Co-authored-by: Mike Purvis <mpurvis@clearpathrobotics.com>
* Also run tests with Python 3.7 and 3.8 (`#590 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/590>`_)
  Signed-off-by: Shane Loretz <sloretz@osrfoundation.org>
* Added option to past list of directories to ``list`` verb (`#572 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/572>`_)
* Fix permissions of created setup files (`#563 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/563>`_)
* Handle empty file in ``get_metadata`` correctly (`#568 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/568>`_)
  If the ``metadata_file_path`` exists but the ``metadata_file`` is empty, ``yaml.safe_load(metadata_file)`` will return None. But the caller expects a dictionary which can lead to a crash. (e.g. in https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/blob/master/catkin_tools/verbs/catkin_build/cli.py#L371)
* add authors/maintainers/licenses to context, which are the default values on package creation (`#548 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/548>`_)
* argument parser: use None instead of [] for empty jobs args (`#575 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/575>`_)
* Fix space-suffix option (`#560 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/560>`_)
* Bash completion for run_tests verb (`#562 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/562>`_)
  * bash completion for run_tests and options
  * also completing packages
* Revert "Set posix=False when parsing environment variables (`#578 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/578>`_)" (`#584 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/584>`_)
  This reverts commit 5b121260a75ffcda863d4588a8e9efc7b4945477.
* Add Travis CI badge to README.md (`#585 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/585>`_)
* Support globs in build/blacklist/whitelist (`#576 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/576>`_)
  * Add glob patterns to build, blacklist and whitelist
  * Add glob patterns to clean
  * Add test for glob pattern build
* Set posix=False when parsing environment variables (`#578 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/578>`_)
* Revert `#561 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/561>`_ (`#582 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/582>`_)
  Now that the project is only targetting python 3.5+, `#561 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/561>`_ is no longer required and we can use the most up-to-date version of ``sphinx`` and ``sphinxcontrib-spelling``.
* Do not load the environment when calling profile to allow to change the profile if the current profile is invalid (`#566 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/566>`_)
* Set Travis to check Python 3.5 and 3.6. (`#580 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/580>`_)
* Python 3 only, migrate from trollius to native asyncio (`#574 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/574>`_)
* fix(controllers): python3 fix for the controllers.py file (`#565 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/565>`_)
* Force sphinxcontrib-spelling less than 4.3.0 (`#561 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/561>`_)
* fix(docs) mechanics to linked develspace (`#546 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/546>`_)

0.4.5 (2019-04-02)
------------------
* Fixed jobserver not working with GNU make >= 4.2 (`#480 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/480>`_)
* Use yaml.safe_load everywhere. (`#542 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/542>`_)
* Fixed unhandled config context options warning (`#489 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/489>`_)
* Added some exception handling for io (`#529 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/529>`_)
* Added opt --active to profile list (`#513 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/513>`_)
* Added build type switch to cheat sheet. (`#522 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/522>`_)
* Fix issue when empty install prefix specified (`#533 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/533>`_)
* Fix bug when workspace contains special characters (`#536 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/536>`_)
  Simply sanitize the workspace name when printing it out
* Add local_setup.* to DEVEL_LINK_BLACKLIST (`#539 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/539>`_)
* Fix notification typo (`#527 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/527>`_)
* When using a non-standard shell fix the usage of DEFAULT_SHELL. (`#511 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/511>`_)
  Previously, using a non-standard shell meant using that non-standard shell's path (shell_path) whereas the shell_name would be bash. Not only is there this discrepancy, but then the command is actually run with the non-standard shell, which is liable to cause runtime errors (as it does if e.g. SHELL=/usr/bin/fish).
* Sort authors/maintainers for correct email assignment (`#492 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/492>`_)
* Fixed 'pip install --user catkin_tools' (`#488 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/488>`_)

* Respect VERBOSE environment variable if already set before in verbose mode (`#506 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/506>`_)
* Re-enable Sphinx spell check. (`#461 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/461>`_)" (`#462 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/462>`_)
* Silence E722 flake8 warnings, fix OSX builds. (`#509 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/509>`_)
* setup.py: Exclude all tests* from install (`#499 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/499>`_)
* Fixed typo: relateive -> relative (`#484 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/484>`_)
* Sanitizes log message input (`#479 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/479>`_)
* Enable arguments with spaces in alias definition (`#476 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/476>`_)
* Fixed zsh completion to actually use zsh caching for package list (`#459 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/459>`_) (`#475 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/475>`_)
* Fixed doc and completion based on current CLI for interleave output (`#467 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/467>`_)
  The current CLI for interleave output proposes to use
  --interleave-output instead of --interleave.
* Add trollius to setup.py `install_requires` list (`#474 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/474>`_)
  closes `#445 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/445>`_
  This patch can be viewed as continuing the work of pull request `#282 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/282>`_.
* Fix typo in documentation of option env-cache (`#466 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/466>`_)
* Implementation of pluggable spaces. (`#458 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/458>`_)
* Disable Sphinx spell check for now. (`#461 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/461>`_)
* Better message when missing a required command line tool. (`#455 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/455>`_)
* Specify return code when build interrupted. (`#452 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/452>`_)
* Drop utf-8 encoding to compute file hashes in symlink stage (`#399 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/399>`_)
* Fix logic which merges environment PATH variables. (`#449 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/449>`_)
* Ignore vim swap files. (`#450 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/450>`_)
* Add tests for isolated builds. (`#444 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/444>`_)
* Correctly merge envvars from isolated workspaces. (`#443 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/443>`_)

* Changed the way symlinks from the private devel spaces were made to better support Python development (`#377 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/377>`_)
* Fixed a unicode error which occurred when there was unicode output from the compiler (`#368 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/368>`_)
* Fixed race condition in build related to reading of install space (fixes `#378 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/378>`_) (`#391 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/issues/391>`_)

0.4.2 (2016-04-19)
------------------

0.4.0 (2016-04-18)
------------------
* Major refactor of the job execution engine to use Trollius/Asyncio.
  * Changed the way build environments are generated (no more ``build.sh``).

* Added support for cleaning and partial cleaning of the workspace with ``catkin clean``.
* Added "shell verbs" like ``catkin cd`` and ``catkin source`` (requires sourcing of shell files).
* Added support for (and testing for) ``DESTDIR``.
* Warnings are now captured and reported to the console even without ``--verbose``.
* Fixed ``setup.py`` installation when using ``--user``.
* Fixed an issue where CMake was always rerun even when the settings didn't change.
* Added support for the ``.built_by`` marker file to detect when being used at the same time as ``catkin_make[_isolated]``.
* Fixed ``catkin create -p``.
* Improved error message when a circular dependency in the packages is detected.

* Contributors: Alexander Schaefer, Dave Coleman, Dirk Thomas, Esteve Fernandez, Ivor Wanders, Jonathan Bohren, Kartik Mohta, Kei Okada, Kentaro Wada, Robert Haschke, Steven Peters, William Woodall

0.3.1 (2015-12-20)
------------------
* Added some new shell based verbs, i.e. ``catkin cd`` and ``catkin source``.
  `#244 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/244>`_
  `#192 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/192>`_
* Use a red icon when a build fails in the notifications.
  `#246 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/246>`_
* Changed how and where shell completion files are installed.
* Improvements to support ``DESTDIR``.
  `#240 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/240>`_
* Added a cross tool check to warn users when they are using ``catkin_tools`` in conjunction with either ``catkin_make`` or ``catkin_make_isolated``.
  `#214 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/214>`_
* Use ``/bin/bash`` as a fallback when the ``SHELL`` environment variable is not set.
  `#239 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/239>`_
  `#243 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/243>`_
* Fix error when ``TERM`` doesn't match (through ``ssh`` for example).
  `#232 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/232>`_

0.3.0 (2015-04-21)
------------------
* Added support for architecture specific libraries directories, a la ``GNUInstallDirs``.
  `#156 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/156>`_
* Fixed a bug in the implementation of the ``--this`` option of the ``catkin build`` verb.
  `#162 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/162>`_
* Fixed parsing of and added options that append, remove, or clear arugments which are actually lists, e.g. ``--cmake-args``.
  `#147 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/147>`_
  `#179 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/179>`_
* Moved the ANSI color related options to the ``catkin`` command and out of the ``catkin build`` verb.
  `#158 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/158>`_
* Fixed a bug where the ``--this`` command could look outside of the workspace.
  `#169 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/169>`_
* Improved the perfomance of listing the result spaces by only loading the environement when asked and caching when needed.
  `#174 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/174>`_
  `#185 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/185>`_
  `#190 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/190>`_
* Added support for blacklisting and whitelisting packages.
  `#175 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/175>`_
* Some warnings from ``catkin_pkg`` are now suppressed in some verbs. Requires ``catkin_pkg`` >= 0.2.8.
  `#163 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/163>`_
* Added an internal implementation of the GNU Make server which consolidates jobs amoungst multiple runs of ``make``.
  This has the affect of limiting the total number of jobs make is running even when using a large ``-p`` value.
  This changes the default behavior of the tool, to get the old behavior simply add ``--no-jobserver`` to ``catkin build``.
  This can be set in your build profile with ``catkin config``, or you could use a verb alias to always pass it.
  In general this new default behavior should prevent systems from being brought to their knees by ``catkin build``.
  `#155 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/155>`_
* Added the ``catkin locate`` verb.
  `#165 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/165>`_

  `#168 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/168>`_

0.2.2 (2015-03-09)
------------------
* Added the ``--no-color`` option to the build verb which forces ``catkin build`` to not output color.
* Fixed a bug in a console message.

0.2.1 (2015-02-23)
------------------
* Added options ``--continue-on-error`` and ``--summarize`` (`#138 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/138>`_)
* Added option for limiting status line updates, ``--status-rate`` (`#141 <https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools/pull/141>`_)
* Made small fixes to the generated documentation.
* Fixed a bug where ``run_depends`` were not considered in topological ordering.
* Consolidated functions to calculate terminal width.
* Improved failure condition of missing ``cmake`` and ``make`` cli tools.
